# Cashew Roux Gumbo

## Intro

- Prep Time: 35 minutes
- Serves: 4

## Ingredients

### Roux

- 1/2 Cup Cashews
- 1/2 Cup Water
- 2 Tbsp White Miso
- 1 Shallot
- 1/2 Onion
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 1 Tbsp Dried Thyme
- Juice of 1 Lime

### Gumbo

- 3/4 Lb Okra (cut in 1 cm. pieces)
- 2 Red Potatoes (cubed)
- 10 oz. Package Little Tomatoes
- 1/4 Cup Short Grain Rice
- 1 Tsp - 1 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper
- More water

## Instructions

Put the cashews, the 1/2 cup water and the white miso in a magic bullet, high powered blender, etc. Blend it the mixture until it is smooth and creamy.

Dice the onions, shallots and garlic. Place them in a soup pot with the thyme and saute in a 1/2 cup water. When the onions are translucent add the cashew cream and the juice of 1 lime to the pot and stir until mixed well. You can add a little water to keep it from drying out.

Next, add everything else to the pot and cover with the creamy roux. Add water until everything is covered and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 25 minutes.

## Notes

- Try with black-eyed peas
- Take out the potatoes
- Maybe try Red Miso
- Try w/out the shallot
