# Cashew Roux Gumbo

## Intro

- Prep Time: 45 minutes
- Serves: 4

Growing up in Texas, just a short distance from Louisiana, I was exposed early to traditional Cajun dishes like Gumbo and Etoufee. They always seemed to make their appearance at major holidays and potlucks. The roux at the core of the gumbo is basically made of butter and flour. I just knew there had to be a better way. Enter the cashew.

## Ingredients

### Roux

- 1/2 Cup Cashews
- 1/2 Cup Water
- 2 Tbsp White Miso
- 1 Onion
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 1 Tbsp Dried Thyme
- Juice of 1 Lemon

### Gumbo

- 1lb Lb Okra (cut in 1 cm. pieces)
- 2 Cups Cooked Blackeyed Peas
- 10 oz. Package Little Tomatoes
- 1/4 Cup Short Grain Rice
- 1 Tsp - 1 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper
- 1 Tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
- More water

## Instructions

Put the cashews, the 1/2 cup water and the white miso in a magic bullet, high powered blender, etc. Blend it the mixture until it is smooth and creamy.

Dice the onion and cloves of garlic. Place them in a soup pot with the thyme and saute in a 1/2 cup water. When the onions are translucent add the cashew cream and the juice of 1 lemon to the pot and stir until mixed well. You can add a little water to keep it from drying out.

Next, add everything else to the pot and cover with the creamy roux. Add water until everything is covered and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 35 minutes.

## Notes

- Take out the potatoes
- Maybe try Red Miso
- Write an intro
