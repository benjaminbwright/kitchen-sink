# Cashew Roux Gumbo Recipe

## Intro

- Prep Time: 45 minutes
- Serves: 4

Growing up in Texas, just a short distance from Louisiana, I was exposed early to traditional Cajun dishes like Gumbo and Etoufee. They always seemed to make their appearance at major holidays and potlucks, and rarely did a gumbo fail to satisfy. When I decided to learn how to make Gumbo myself, I quickly discovered that I would need to learn how to begin by making a delicious roux. The roux at the core of the gumbo is basically made of butter and flour. I know. That already sounds like a great start. From there you can begin to add any number of delicious additions. As I've begun to move a way from animal fats and refined grains like flour, I've had to come up with better ways to approach the recipes I grew up around. So, after much experimentation I was able to achieve a delicious gumbo recipe by building my roux with cashews and white miso. Enjoy!

## Ingredients

### Roux

- 1/2 cup Cashews
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 tablespoon white miso
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- juice of 1 lemon

### Gumbo

- 1 pound okra (cut in 1 cm. pieces)
- 2 cups cooked blackeyed peas
- 10 ounce package cocktail tomatoes
- 1/4 cup brown short-grain rice
- 1 teaspoon - 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspon apple cider vinegar
- more water

## Instructions

Put the cashews, the 1/2 cup water and the white miso in a magic bullet, high powered blender, etc. Blend the mixture until it is smooth and creamy.

Dice the onion and cloves of garlic. Place them in a soup pot with the thyme and saute in a 1/2 cup water. Add just enough water that the onions do not stick and burn. When the onions are translucent add the cashew cream and the juice of 1 lemon to the pot and stir until mixed well. Continue to add a little water as needed to keep the mixture from drying out.

Next, add everything else to the pot and cover with the creamy roux. Add water until everything is covered and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 35 minutes. Be sure to stir periodically when to keep the mixture from sticking.
