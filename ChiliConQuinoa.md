# Chili Con Quinoa

## Intro

- Prep Time: 35 minutes
- Serves: 6

Everybody loves a good chili in the winter time. I love a good chili just about any time, and growing up on Tex-Mex has left me with a somewhat refined palette. It would be impossible to count the number of dishes that I crave that require some kind of chili. Just about all of these require meat. Considering the health consequences of eating meat, I had to find another way to make delicious vegetarian chili recipe to fill the gap in many of my favorite Tex-Mex dishes. Therefore, *chili con carne* has become *chili con quinoa.*

## Ingredients

- water
- 1 1/4 cups uncooked quinoa
- 1 can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1/2 cup ground oatmeal (oatmeal flour)
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened dark chocolate

## Instructions

Pour 2 1/2 cups of water into a 3 quart pot. Add the 1 1/4 cups of quinoa to the pot and bring to a boil. When the pot comes to a boil, lower the heat and cover the quinoa and let cook for 15 minutes.

While the quinoa is cooking, put the chocolate, cumin, garlic, onion, paprika, and peanut butter into a food processor or blender. Add about 2 cups of water, and blend the mixture until it creates a runny paste.

When the quinoa has softened, stir in the chili paste. Let this mixture cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the liquid in the pan.

Add the ground oatmeal to the chili for thickening, and stir until all of the lumps are gone.
